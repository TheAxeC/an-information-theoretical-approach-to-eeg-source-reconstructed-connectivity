Determining how distinct brain regions are connected and communicate with each other will shed light on how behaviour emerges. In EEG studies, interpreting connectivity measures can be problematic, due to the high correlation between signals recorded from the scalp surface, a result of the volume conductance of the scalp and skin. Therefore, meaningful connectivity patterns can be measured only from the from the spatiotemporal distribution of localised cortical sources, generally referred to as source reconstruction. Still, spurious connectivity issues may persist in source reconstructed EEG data, rendering it vital to choose an appropriate measure of connectivity. In this work, an information theoretical approach, which concerns model-free, probability based methods such as mutual information, conditional mutual information and interaction information, is taken. An information theoretical framework for Python is developed in order to operate on source reconstructed activity. This framework is used to perform a connectivity analysis of a high density source reconstructed EEG dataset, which was constructed in an experiment regarding semantic processing of abstract and concrete words.

  For me, this thesis was an adventure through different unknown lands. Luckily, I had a guide in the form of my mentor and my supervisor. I was able to become familiar with an extraordinarily interesting field of research and I am excited to be able to continue my research within this field. \\ 
\\
First and foremost, I would like to thank my mentor, Mansoureh Fahimi, and my supervisor, prof. Marc Van Hulle. I would also like to thank prof. dr. Daniele Marinazzo for his valuable advice during my research. Finally, an additional thanks goes to the assessors for reading the text.
